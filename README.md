```yaml
version: '3.9'

services:
  paradis-bot:
    image: ghcr.io/saenyakorn/paradis-bot:1.0.0
    container_name: paradis-bot
    # restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      DISCORD_TOKEN: <secret>
      DISCORD_CLIENT_ID: <client-id>
      DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET: <secret>
      DATABASE_URL: postgres://postgres:postgres@postgres:5432/paradis-bot
      APP_PORT: 3000
      APP_GLOBAL_PREFIX: api # Now, you can test the simple REST API on http://localhost:3000/api
    depends_on:
      - postgres
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
  postgres:
    image: postgres:14
    restart: unless-stopped
    container_name: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: paradis-bot
